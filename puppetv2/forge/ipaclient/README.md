IPAclient
========

This module configures clients to use FreeIPA with as little fuss as possible.

Feedback and pull requests are very welcome.

What's New
----------

(Experimental) Ubuntu support!

Refactored parameters to have better names, version
2.0 isn't compatible with previous versions of the
module.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Tested on:
  * RHEL and CentOS 6
  * Fedora 20
  * Ubuntu 14.04

It should hopefully work on any recent Red Hat or Debian
distro with IPA packages.  

Examples
--------

See the manifests for full descriptions of the various parameters
available.

Discovery register (w/ sane defaults: sudo, mkhomedir, ssh, etc):

    class { 'ipaclient':
      password => "rainbows"
    }

More complex:

    class { 'ipaclient':
       principal       => "admin",
       password        => "unicorns",
       server          => ["ipa01.pixiedust.com", "ipa02.pixiedust.com"]
       domain          => "pixiedust.com",
       realm           => "PIXEDUST.COM",
       mkhomedir       => false,
       automount       => true,
       ssh             => false,
       fixed_primary   => true
       automount_location => "home",
    }

Simple sudoers setup:

    class { 'ipaclient::sudoers': }

Automounter only:

    class { 'ipaclient::automount':
        location    => 'home',
        server      => 'ipa01.pixiedust.com',
    }
